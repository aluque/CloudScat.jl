# This is a sample input file for the cloudscat.jl cloud-scattering code.
#
# The format is YAML, as interpreted by the YAML.jl julia package.
#
# The input in general consists of a `parameters` element with parameter: value pairs
# and a list of observers, each of them being a dictionary with parameter: value pairs.
#
# All unitful magnitudes are specified in SI units.


# Optionally one can include some additional files using includes: [file1, file2...].
# Here we include a file with the optical properties of the cloud (valid for a given
# wavelength and droplet radius) and the description of several observers.
includes: [777nm_20um.yaml, observers.yaml]

parameters:
  # Droplet density inside the cloud
  nscat : 1e8    # 100 * co.centi^-3

  # Cloud limits.  The cloud is contained between two planes at these altitudes above ground.
  cloud_base : 6000
  cloud_top : 15000

  # Currently the source is modelled as a vertical segment.
  # Location of the source center
  source_altitude : 10000
    
  # Vertical extension of the source.  Zero here means a point source.
  # In this case the source extends from 6 to 14 km.
  source_extension: 4000
  
  # Initial number of computational photons
  N : 1000000

# Example files for the Geoscientific Model Development submission

This folder contains the input files employed for the production of the
manuscript "Modeling lightning observations from space-based platforms (CloudScat.jl 1.0)" submitted to Geoscientific Model Development.  As well as python scripts to produce the figures.

The input files for each paper section are:

* For section *Photon diffusion model*, `first_hitting.jl` and `first_hitting_lowerbnd.jl`.
* For *Ozone absorption*, `ozone_absorption_*.jl`.
* For *Imaging complex geometries*, `cloud_geometry.jl` and `cloud_geometry_777.jl`.
* For *Imaging at different wavelenghts*, `wavelength_2_*.jl`.
* For *Interpretation of an MMIA observation*, `asim_27386.jl`.

""" 
This is a sample input file for the CloudScat2 code.  To use it run julia
and type 

julia> include("scan_depths.jl")

The output file will be based on this file's name so to run different simulations
you can just copy this file, change the configuration and run it as above with
the new file name.  You can also run from the command line as e.g.

> julia scan_depths.jl
